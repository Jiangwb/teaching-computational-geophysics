# Computational Geophysics Course

An introduction to finite-difference, pseudo-spectral, finite-element, and spectral-element methods will be presented 
and applied to basic geophysical problems including heat flow and wave propagation. 

The course offers hands-on lab experience in numerically solving partial differential equations relevant to geophysics.
